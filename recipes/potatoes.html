    <p>These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite — he considers it a special <br>
       occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in <br>
       this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: Slice Russet potatoes into 1/4-inch (or thinner) slices. <br>
            Use a mandoline slicer if you have one.</li>
        <li>Onion: Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply <br>
            seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Butter and flour: The cheese sauce starts with a roux <br>
            made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Milk: Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to <br>
            create the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li>Cheese: This recipe uses freshly shredded Cheddar. <br>
            Use sharp white Cheddar to keep sauce lighter in color.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Assemble the casserole: Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of <br>
            the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then <br>
            top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour <br>
            and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, <br>
            whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the casserole: Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with <br>
            foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
