    <p>An omelette is an egg dish that's folded in half and filled with cheese, meat, or vegetables. <br>
       Next time you go out to breakfast, try ordering an omelette instead of your usual <strong>fried eggs!</strong> <br>
       The word omelette is French, from a root meaning "thin, small plate," a reference to an omelette's flat shape.</p>
